This paper investigates the role of organisational structure and culture on the quality of software delivered. In this paper, the team studies the culture and organization of a company and observes which factors affect the quality of the code adversely. The authors identify many factors like the complexity of documenting features, issues in resolving external and internal dependencies issues, testing of cloud based services, lack of human resource planning, the need to engage in organisational politics and not go over budget are identified as negatively affecting the quality of the developer's work. The authors believe that by addressing these shortcomings in a company's organisation the quality could be improved substantially.

I believe that the paper has acted a bit pre-maturely by just studying one organiscuation and generalising that his will be true for eveynoe else. Also, I believe that organizational difficulties vary from organization to organization and therefore what might hold true in the survey would cease to hold true in another organisation.
